## What it is

A local server that speaks the MCP protocol and gives Claude, and any other
MCP-compatible agent, a long-term memory. It captures every turn of every session
verbatim, organizes those captures over time into a personal map of who you are,
and serves a small slice of relevant memory back at the start of each new
conversation and turn. You never have to say *"remember this"* or *"what did we
say last time?"*.

I built this for myself. It worked. The benchmarks were mostly for my own
curiosity.

Under the hood it's not a wrapper around someone else's vector store and graph
library — the parts that matter are my own code: the storage engine, the
community-detection algorithm, the hyperdimensional memory substrate, and a
native engine that makes it fast.

And unlike cloud memory services, there's no API key, no account, and no
telemetry: the engine, the store, and the embeddings all run locally. The only
things that leave your machine are the normal model calls your CLI already makes,
plus one optional nightly consolidation step that asks your model for a single
insight through the same subscription your CLI already uses.

---

## Quick start

### Claude Code

```bash
python3.12 -m pip install -U iai-pme
```

Then run inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add CodeAbra/iai-personal-memory-engine
/plugin install iai-memory@iai-pme
```

Restart the session, then verify:

```bash
iai --version
iai-mcp daemon status
iai-mcp doctor
```

Python 3.11 is also supported.

### macOS or Linux: all-in-one source install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeAbra/iai-personal-memory-engine/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

This builds the Rust engine and TypeScript wrapper, installs the background
service and hooks, registers Claude Code, and runs the health check. It requires
Git, Python 3.11/3.12, Node.js 18+, and Rust. To inspect the steps without
changing anything:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeAbra/iai-personal-memory-engine/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- --dry-run
```

### Other hosts

```bash
python3.12 -m pip install -U iai-pme
iai-mcp crypto init
iai-mcp daemon install
iai-mcp capture-hooks install --target codex
```

Replace `codex` with `cursor`, `antigravity`, `hermes`, `openclaw`, or `all`.
MCP tools work with any MCP-over-stdio client; automatic capture and context
injection depend on the hooks exposed by the host. See the
[technical reference](docs/REFERENCE.md).

New stores use the native engine format by default; an existing store keeps its
current format on upgrade. To move an existing legacy SQLite store onto the
native engine, run `iai-mcp migrate-to-lilli` — `iai-mcp doctor` prints the exact
command, and the [technical reference](docs/REFERENCE.md) documents the full flow.

---

## What happens after installation

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| Prompt | New turns are appended to a session buffer as file IO; no embedding or engine RPC is needed on the capture path |
| Session end | Remaining transcript content is rolled over for ingestion; hook failures do not block the host |
| Session start | A bounded memory prefix is exposed as host context; an empty store or unavailable engine yields empty output |
| Later turns | Supported hosts receive a small foresight or delta pack with age and revision markers |
| Idle time | Captures are embedded, deduplicated, encrypted, inserted, clustered, consolidated, reinforced, and decayed |

The background process is called the `daemon` in the CLI. The MCP wrapper and
`iai` can still read the local store directly when it is asleep or temporarily
unavailable.

---

## How it works

### Memory model

| Tier | Contains |
|---|---|
| **Episodic** | Timestamped, write-once fragments of what was said |
| **Semantic** | Summaries induced from related episodes during idle consolidation |
| **Procedural** | Ten bounded behavioural parameters learned over time |

Distinct hyperdimensional representations keep literal detail, semantic
structure, and behavioural tendencies from collapsing into one vector surface.

The local, LLM-free recall path combines semantic similarity, graph evidence,
recency, temporal validity, and lexical evidence. `memory_recall` returns both
`hits` and `anti_hits`; `memory_contradict` closes the old record's validity
interval, creates a new record, and links the two.

While idle, the engine groups related episodes, induces semantic memory,
reinforces useful paths, and decays weak unreviewed edges. One optional REM step
may invoke `claude -p` through the user's existing Claude subscription, capped
at no more than 1% of the daily quota. No Anthropic API key is required.

### First-party components

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **Hippo** | Encrypted records, vector index, and graph in one local store |
| **MOSAIC** | Leiden-family community detection with stable community identity |
| **Lilli HD** | Hyperdimensional substrate and structural recall |
| **Native engine** | Rust embedder and graph kernels |

---

## Dashboard and CLI

```bash
iai brain
```

The local dashboard searches the store, exposes graph neighbourhoods and
contradictions, pins or fades memories, ingests files, controls the background
engine, and reports token-use estimates from your own store.

```text
iai recall · temporal-recall · search · ask · capture · teach · upload
iai watch · brain · status · last
```

`iai upload` accepts documents, Office files, e-books, source code,
configuration files, and directories. Full formats and administrative commands
are listed in [`docs/REFERENCE.md`](docs/REFERENCE.md).

---

## Benchmarks

Every harness ships in `bench/`; methodology and reproduce commands are in
[`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md).

| Benchmark | Result |
|---|---:|
| Rescue@10 after contradiction | **1.000** |
| Historical-verbatim hit@10 | **1.000** |
| LongMemEval-S R@5, product embedder | **0.962** |
| LongMemEval-S R@10, product embedder | **0.978** |

Historical-verbatim retrieval uses a flat-cosine baseline of about 0.71. With
the matched `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedder, iai-memory and mempalace v3.3.6 both
score R@5 `0.966` and R@10 `0.978`; no win is claimed.

On the author's store, an automatically injected memory pack averaged about
350 tokens versus about 2,850 tokens for the agent-search round trip it
replaced: approximately 88% cheaper on that measured workload. This does not
apply to explicit `memory_recall`, whose default response budget is 1,500
tokens.

---

## MCP tools

```text
memory_recall              memory_temporal_recall
memory_recall_structural   memory_search
memory_capture             memory_contradict
memory_reinforce           memory_consolidate
profile_get_set            topology
schema_list                events_query
episodes_recent            curiosity_pending
```

Fourteen tools cover cue, temporal, structural, and lexical recall; capture and
correction; reinforcement and consolidation; behavioural-profile control; and
store introspection.

---

## Compatibility

| Host | Ambient behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Session-start recall, per-turn updates, turn capture, and session capture |
| **Codex CLI** | Full integration through Codex hooks |
| **Cursor** | Session-start recall and capture; no per-turn text injection |
| **Antigravity** | Recall per invocation and lossless transcript capture |
| **Hermes 0.5.0+** | Recall before model calls and capture from its message store |
| **OpenClaw** | MCP tools on request; no ambient shell hooks |
| **Gemini CLI and other MCP hosts** | MCP tools; no bundled host-specific hooks unless listed above |
| **Claude Desktop** | MCP tools; plain Chat does not expose Claude Code-style ambient hooks |

---

## Privacy and limitations

- Records are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. The store and key live under
  `~/.iai-mcp/`; back them up together.
- macOS and Linux use a Unix socket. Windows uses an ephemeral loopback port
  with a per-user token.
- There is no iai-memory account, telemetry pipeline, hosted dashboard, or
  cross-machine sync.
- Optional iai-memory network activity is the REM `claude -p` step and a daily
  PyPI version check. Set `IAI_MCP_VERSION_CHECK=0` to disable the check.
- The store refuses to mix incompatible embedding generations; changing the
  embedder requires an explicit migration.
- Recall is usually mediocre during roughly the first ten sessions, and quality
  and latency depend on corpus size, language, embedder, and stored history.
- The default store is English-first. Raw non-English records require an
  explicit `raw:<lang>` tag and a multilingual or custom embedder.
- Windows support is beta. Ambient behaviour varies with host hook support.
- The project is solo-maintained and has no enterprise SLA.

Health and updates:

```bash
iai-mcp doctor          # 38 checks
iai-mcp daemon status
iai-mcp self-update
```

## About the name

**iai** is a personal memory engine: one person's memory, on one machine, used
by the assistant they already have.

The design is local-first and verbatim-first. The engine, store, embeddings,
and native core all run on your machine; there is no account, no telemetry, and
no cloud memory dependency. Retrieval keeps the original episodic wording rather
than replacing it with a summary, and builds semantic and procedural structure
around it. Rare events stay rare instead of being smoothed toward a typical
case, and revision history is retained.

The trade-off is more local storage and a stricter retrieval path, in exchange
for preserving detail. Most memory layers aggressively extract a gist; this one
keeps the wording and derives structure from it.

*Earlier versions of this project described the design through a clinical
vocabulary drawn from autism research. That framing has been removed: the
behaviours are real retrieval and ranking choices, but labelling an ML system
with a human psychological profile overstates what the system does and says
something it has no business saying about people. The behaviours remain, under
operational names.*
