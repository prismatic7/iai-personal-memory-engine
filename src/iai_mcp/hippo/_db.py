    A pooled read-only reader is a snapshot-at-open; it never live-tracks the

    most one borrow behind the last commit, and is zero for already-committed
    data — a caller that borrows after a commit always sees it.

    The only connection that evades this fence is a raw writer connection

        ``reembed_pending_rows`` fire sites so a bare ``HippoDB`` used without
        a ``MemoryStore`` (no cache exists there) still bounds RO staleness.
        Double-firing through both routes is harmless — the bump is an
        idempotent int increment. Takes only the pool's own trivial lock,
        never ``_conn_lock``/``_hnsw_lock`` — no new lock-ordering edge.

        RE-PUBLISH (fork): after the bump, republish the writer's built
        col/id index pairs so the slots that refresh on the next borrow can
        ADOPT them instead of paying their own lazy whole-table build. The
        engine's id index is per-connection and in-memory only (there is no
        on-disk id index — only ``records.colindex`` is persisted), so a slot
        refresh is otherwise forced to rescan the entire ``records`` table on
        its first indexed read. Measured on a 13.6k-record store: first
        point-lookup after a refresh visits 13,654 cells and takes ~1.0 s on
        the live store, versus 0 cells / 0.3 ms when the index is adopted.
        With refreshes firing on every writer commit, that cost was paid
        repeatedly (1,569 slow point-lookups totalling ~1,193 s in one
        logged window).

        ``publish_read_models`` is idempotent and cheap (~70 ms) and the
        engine's own adoption already re-verifies a write-generation stamp
        per table, so republishing here cannot make a reader serve stale
        rows — a mismatched stamp is simply not adopted, and the lazy build
        remains the always-correct fallback. No-raise, like the bump above.
