"""Pooled read-only reader connections for the lilli storage engine.

Wraps the lock-free ``get_lilli_raw_conn(path, read_only=True)`` primitive in a
fixed-size pool so the recall read path never contends on the writer's
``_conn_lock``. On the stdlib driver this module is not constructed at all —
``HippoDB.ro_conn()`` falls back to the existing shared-connection path.

Staleness model: each pool slot is a snapshot-at-open reader (the native
``open_read_only`` overlays committed WAL frames at open time; it does not
live-track the writer afterward). That snapshot-at-open property is the
HAZARD this module closes, not the observed behavior of a borrowed slot: a
slot is refreshed (closed and reopened) the next time it is borrowed after
the pool's generation counter has been bumped by any mutating statement on
the writer connection (not only a corpus-count-changing one) — never
eagerly, never on a read. On the writer-proxy path, already-committed data
is never stale: a slot refreshes on its next borrow after any commit. This
keeps read-heavy windows on a warm parse/col-cache connection while bounding
staleness to "at most one borrow behind the last commit".
