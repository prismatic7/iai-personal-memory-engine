"""Working tier: one focal active task plus a bounded park of suspended tasks.

Process-global, in-process RAM only — never touches Hippo directly, never
an HD-encoded persisted representation. The awake recall path must never
import this module. Text fields are the verbatim source of truth; the BSC
structure hypervector is an optional similarity accelerator only and is
never reconstructed back into text.

Attention is unitary: exactly one focal task accumulates turns at any
moment. A turn arriving from a different session is an explicit task
switch — the focal task is parked (its durable results written through to
the episodic store first), and the parked task for the arriving session is
restored or a fresh one opened. The park is a small LRU keyed by session;
eviction closes the task fully. A parked task is never fed and never
injected into any session but its own.

A plaintext snapshot of each task is additionally emitted to a per-session
cache file (0600, atomic replace) — the same daemon-written /
reader-consumed pattern as the session-start payload cache — so external
per-turn readers (shell hooks) can surface their own session's task WITHOUT
a daemon socket round-trip and without importing this module.
