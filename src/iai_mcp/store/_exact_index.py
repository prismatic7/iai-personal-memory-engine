"""Resident exact-cosine matrix — the lossless similarity authority.

Holds a normalized float32 matrix of active-corpus embeddings in process
memory and answers exact top-k cosine similarity directly, without an
approximate index. This is the exact-similarity authority over a lossy fast
index: the store remains the source of truth, a cold or stale index degrades
to a rebuild, never to data loss. Never serialized to disk.

Thread safety: all mutation and the top-k read are guarded by an internal
``threading.Lock``. ``top_k`` computes the full similarity scan under the
lock (a sub-millisecond hold at tens of thousands of rows) so a concurrent
upsert can never tear a row mid-read. ``build`` installs the full matrix,
id list, and id-to-row map in ONE lock hold (the replace-all discipline) so
a concurrent reader sees either the complete old state or the complete new
state, never a half-filled intermediate.

The module imports numpy and stdlib only — no hippo, sqlite, crypto, or
hnswlib dependency.
