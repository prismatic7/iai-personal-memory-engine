"""Resident lexical (identifier-grade) index over decrypted surfaces.

Semantic similarity is weak exactly where code work is strongest: exact
identifiers (`_hippea_cascade_loop`, `IAI_MCP_FORESIGHT_OFF`). This index
gives the awake store a lexical lane beside the semantic one: an inverted
token map built in RAM from decrypted surfaces — plaintext lives only in
process memory, never on disk, so the at-rest encryption posture is
untouched.

Freshness model: the index remembers the corpus-count-cache generation it
was built against and rebuilds on demand when the generation moved (any
corpus-changing write bumps it). Queries are AND-of-tokens ranked by term
frequency; camelCase and snake_case identifiers match both whole and by
their parts.
