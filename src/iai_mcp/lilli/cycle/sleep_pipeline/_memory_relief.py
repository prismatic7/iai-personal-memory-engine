"""Force the process allocator to return freed pages to the OS.

Called at the dispatch-loop tail after a heavy sleep step has finished and
released its store/index locks.  A single best-effort action is taken:

  1. ``gc.collect()`` — reclaim Python cycles holding large transients.

Resident-set size is read with the *current* RSS primitive
(``psutil.Process().memory_info().rss``), not peak RSS — peak is monotonic and
can never show a reclaim. The step is wrapped fail-soft: the helper must never
raise on any platform, because it runs after a successful step whose progress
is already persisted.

Allocator-arena reclaim primitives are deliberately NOT called here:

* ``malloc_zone_pressure_relief`` measured **0.0 MB reclaimed** on this host's
  allocator across every transient shape tested (200×4 MiB blocks, 40×32 MiB
  blocks, 300k×1 KiB objects) — a real negative result, so skipping it is
  correct.
* ``gc.collect()`` is NOT redundant with it: the same shapes measured
  **824.9 → 278.8 MB** and **1808.5 → 421.7 MB** reclaimed. The relief below is
  therefore load-bearing, not a formality.

The earlier rationale here said the allocator was mimalloc and that its
page-return "is governed by the allocator's own decommit-on-free behaviour
(tuned via environment variables in the launchd plist)". **That premise is
false and has been retracted:** mimalloc is not loaded in this daemon at all
(``vmmap`` shows zero mimalloc regions; the OS/``DefaultMallocZone`` allocator
handles everything, and mimalloc is not a dependency anywhere in the tree).
Moreover the three ``MIMALLOC_*`` vars the plist ships
(``MIMALLOC_ALLOW_DECOMMIT`` / ``_DECOMMIT_DELAY`` / ``_SEGMENT_DECOMMIT_DELAY``)
are **not real mimalloc options** — none appear in mimalloc's own 48-option
dump, and upstream documents no such names. The real equivalents are
``MIMALLOC_PURGE_DECOMMITS`` / ``MIMALLOC_PURGE_DELAY`` /
``MIMALLOC_ARENA_EAGER_COMMIT``.

Finally, preloading mimalloc here would be actively harmful: measured on the
same transient it retains **823 MB** after free versus libmalloc's **278 MB**
(three bursts, identical; unchanged by any knob set). Mimalloc purges rather
than frees, so do not add it to this workload.

``zone_reclaimed_mb`` is kept at 0.0 in the telemetry dict for schema
stability (existing event readers expect the key).
