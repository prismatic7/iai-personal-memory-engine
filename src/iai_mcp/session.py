    working-tier snapshot's atomic tmp+chmod(0600)+os.replace idiom, resolved
    under the same store root. Nothing precedes the first open sentinel; an
    empty segment writes its sentinel pair with no inner lines.

    A thin park-then-reopen (a task switch that opens a fresh, still-empty
    entry) must never clobber a substantive live-state block already on
    disk -- the eager file is the sole reconstruction source across a
    /clear, and the new session's own entry has no next_action yet.
    allow_downgrade=True bypasses this guard for an explicit close or an
    explicit caller-cleared focus/next_action, where an empty block IS the
    new ground truth.

    When session_id is a real (non-"-") id, a sidecar records the last
    writer's session so a reader from a different session can refuse this
    shared file (fail open when either side is unknown) -- the sidecar is
    stamped only on the path where the cache body actually changes, never
    on the no-op refresh. "-" is this codebase's own sentinel for "no known
    session id"; a body-changing write with that sentinel unlinks the
    sidecar instead of stamping it, so a reader sees "absent -> unknown ->
    fail open" rather than a stale prior owner's id attributed to content
    that owner never wrote. session_id=None means the caller has no session
    opinion at all (e.g. an agent-registry-only update) -- it must leave any
