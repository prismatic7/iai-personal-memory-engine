//! Paged file with a bounded LRU page cache, per-page checksums, and
//! dirty/pinned tracking.
//!
//! The pager owns the store file and mediates all page access. A page read from
//! disk is verified against its trailing per-page checksum and rejected on
//! mismatch. Writes land in an in-memory cache and are flushed durably on
//! [`Pager::flush`]. The cache is bounded by an optional page budget; only
//! clean, unpinned pages are evicted, so a dirty or pinned page is never
//! dropped regardless of pressure.
//!
//! Page roles follow the reference layout: page 1 is the 100-byte database
//! header, the B+tree root is reserved at page 2, and the meta page is reserved
//! at page 3. Higher layers build on these reservations.
