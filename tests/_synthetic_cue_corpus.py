"""Synthetic, non-owner, production-shaped corpus and cue generator.

Underscore-prefixed so pytest never collects this as a test module.

Builds a wholly synthetic natural-language corpus (alice-style, never derived
from any real store or session transcript) and a 3-band cue set (specific /
vague / novel) through the real ``Embedder()`` -- never the hash-based bench
fake, so the semantic distances between "specific"/"vague"/"novel" cues and
the corpus are the real ones an embedding model produces, not an approximation
of them.
