"""Recall-ranking differential harness.

Compares two ranked-result producers end-to-end on production-shaped,
3-band, real-embedded cues and asserts byte-identical (tie-tolerant) top-k
on both storage drivers. The producer is a callable parameter --
`(cue, mode, cue_intent, k) -> list[tuple[record_id, score]]` -- so a future
Rust candidate producer registers here with zero edits to the comparison
loop itself.

Today's Python recall path is registered as BOTH the reference and the
candidate producer, proving the harness is deterministic and driver-agnostic
before any Rust candidate exists. Non-vacuity is proven by two committed
positive controls (a perturbed-score producer and a perturbed-membership
producer), both routed through the exact same comparison loop the green
path-vs-itself test uses.

# every candidate's score by the same constant, never reordering anything).
# Each of the 12 Bucket-A terms in the frozen fused-score term table gets
# its own probe pair on a small, purpose-built fixture
# (build_term_discrimination_fixture) and its own targeted corruption, then
# is driven through _run_differential exactly like every other control in
# this file.
#
# T5 (spread_contrib) and T7 (structural_similarity) are OFF by default in
# production (W_SPREAD_ACT=0.0; structural_weight defaults to 0.0 via

# existing kill-switch/knob for the probe call. This is not a corpus-
# flatness fix: no amount of corpus structure makes either term's
# contribution nonzero while its knob is off. The Rust port still must
# implement the formula correctly for when the knob is on, so the control
# stays meaningful -- but it is a materially weaker guarantee than a term
# that fires under default settings, and is labelled as such below.
